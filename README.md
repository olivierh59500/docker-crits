# About this Repo

This is the Git repo of the Docker image for [pnelson/crits](https://registry.hub.docker.com/pnelson/docker-crits/). See the Hub page for the full readme on how to use the Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

The full readme is generated over in [pnelson/docker-crits-docs](https://github.com/pnelson/docker-crits-docs),
specificially in [pnelson/docker-crits-docs/crits](https://github.com/pnelson/docker-crits-docs/crits).

This is a work in progress and should serve multiple purposes:

1. Provide a useable docker container for [CRITs](https://github.com/crits/crits) in the Docker Registry
1. Teach me how to use TravisCI and Stackbrew tools for automation
